  I have started this project to gain a deeper understanding of the maths and sequences around the control af multi axis
  motion, the project uses a Clicker2 MZ from MikroElectronika which has the pic32mz2048efh100 chip on it.
  
  The axis control uses OCx output compare modules in dual single pulse mode as core independant pin, which should free up 
  further resources once the timers are clocking to drive the pulses. 
  
  Communication is vial serial and DMA is activated, this needs implimenting properly once all the interpolators have been taken care of.
